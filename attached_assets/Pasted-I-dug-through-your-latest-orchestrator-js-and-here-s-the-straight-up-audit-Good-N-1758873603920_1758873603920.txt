I dug through your latest **`orchestrator.js`** and here’s the straight-up audit:

---

### ✅ Good News

* **`gatherImagesBySelector(sel, observeMs = 0)` is implemented correctly.**

  * It has the lazy loading phase with a `MutationObserver`.
  * It does respect `observeMs > 0`.
  * Attribute filter includes `['src', 'srcset', 'data-src', 'data-srcset']` → better coverage.
* Immediate collection and lazy phase are cleanly separated.
* Debug logs are crystal-clear (`🔍 LAZY`, `🎯 LAZY LOADING`, etc.).

---

### 🚩 Issues / Overlaps

1. **Call Sites Don’t Use `observeMs`:**

   * Everywhere else in the code still calls it like:

     ```js
     await gatherImagesBySelector('.product-gallery img');
     ```
   * That means lazy loading is *never triggered*. Needs updating to:

     ```js
     await gatherImagesBySelector('.product-gallery img', 1200);
     ```

2. **Duplicate Filtering Logic:**

   * Inside `gatherImagesBySelector`, you’re re-checking junk patterns (e.g., `_web.png`, `yotpo.com`, `boucle`) multiple times for `src`, `srcset`, and `<picture>` sources.
   * Same block repeated 3 times = bloat.

   👉 **Fix:** Extract a helper like:

   ```js
   function isJunkImage(url) {
     return /(_web\.png|_modal_|yotpo\.com|-\d{3}\.png|boucle|basketweave|velvet|cushion-image|cld\.accentuate\.io)/i.test(url);
   }
   ```

   Then call once for all attributes.

3. **Too Many Scoring Passes:**

   * `hybridUniqueImages()` already filters aggressively (junk, duplicates, CDN upgrades).
   * But `gatherImagesBySelector` is pre-blocking some of the same things.
   * This double-filtering adds noise and slows things down.

   👉 **Fix:** Let `hybridUniqueImages()` handle 90% of filtering, keep only **critical domain-specific filters** (Shopify, Yotpo).

4. **Debug Duplication:**

   * Every branch logs “❌ BLOCKED” with different emojis.
   * Debug is useful, but right now it’s *too verbose*.
   * You want: *one pass, one reason per URL*.

---

### 🎯 My Recommendations (what to tell Replit)

1. **Keep one main function:**

   * `gatherImagesBySelector(sel, observeMs = 0)`
   * Don’t split into 3 near-identical loops for `src`, `srcset`, `picture`. Just normalize all candidate URLs into a single array → pass into `hybridUniqueImages()`.

2. **Deduplicate Filters:**

   * Move Shopify/theme junk checks + generic junk regex into `isJunkImage()`.
   * Call once before adding URL to `enrichedUrls`.

3. **Simplify Debug:**

   * Instead of 30 different “❌ BLOCKED” logs, log once per image with reason. Example:

     ```
     ❌ BLOCKED [srcset, Shopify theme asset]: logo.png
     ```

4. **Update Call Sites:**

   * Any gallery selector that needs lazy support → call with `observeMs = 1200`.
   * Example:

     ```js
     await gatherImagesBySelector('.gallery img', 1200);
     ```

---

👉 Bottom line: **You don’t need 5 different scraping functions.**

* Keep **1 master collector** (`gatherImagesBySelector`) + **1 hybrid filter** (`hybridUniqueImages`).
* Drop repeated junk filtering inside each attribute loop.
* Pass `observeMs` at the right call sites.

That trims the fat, keeps debug readable, and makes lazy loading actually *work*.

Do you want me to sketch the **exact refactor blueprint** (step-by-step tasks for Replit) so you can paste it as instructions?
