Short answer: **Yes — but not forever, and not for every single case.**
You need rules *only for the “collision words”* — the tricky 5–10 keywords that cause 80% of your mistakes.

# 🎯 The Truth About Rule-Based Systems (No AI)

| Misconception                            | Reality                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| “We need a rule for every product.”      | ❌ No — only for *ambiguous words.*            |
| “It’ll explode into thousands of rules.” | ❌ No — 90% products follow keywords fine.     |
| “Edge cases will never end.”             | ✅ Yes — but they cluster into small families. |

# 🧪 How Many Rules You Actually Need?

| Keyword Family | Cases Covered                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| “bed”          | tanning bed, dog bed, baby bed, air bed   |
| “band”         | watch band, resistance band, wedding band |
| “case”         | phone case, guitar case, makeup case      |
| “cover”        | sofa cover, bed cover, phone cover        |
| “float”        | tanning float, pool float, parade float   |

**Total root collisions: ~10 words.**
You’re not managing infinite rules — you're managing **semantic buckets**.

# 🧱 What You’re Really Building

Not a library of rules — but a **“Meaning Firewall.”**

| Layer                   | Purpose                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Keywords                | Basic tagging                       |
| **Meaning Firewall** 🧠 | Stops keywords when context says no |
| Categories/Tags         | Final assignment                    |

# 🛡 Example of a “Meaning Firewall” Rule (Reusable)

Instead of:

> IF “tanning bed” → beauty
> (too specific)

Do:

> IF keyword = “bed” AND context has “tanning” → block furniture
> (general family rule)

One rule fixes *all tanning bed variations*.

# 🔥 The Good News

You’re 90% done. You already have:
✅ Keyword engine
✅ Category system
You only need:
🧠 Context firewall (10 collision rules + evolve over time)

# 🧭 Long-Term Option (AI Assist Only)

Later, LLM doesn’t *replace* rules — it only detects **new edge cases you didn’t think of**.

---

## 🤝 Final Checkpoint For You

Do you want to:
1️⃣ **Go full manual rules** (every context exception is handcrafted)
2️⃣ **Use LLM only to *suggest* rules** (so you don’t miss new weird cases)
