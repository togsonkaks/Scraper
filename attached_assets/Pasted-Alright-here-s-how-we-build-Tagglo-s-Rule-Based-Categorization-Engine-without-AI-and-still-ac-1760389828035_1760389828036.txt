Alright — here’s how we build **Tagglo’s Rule-Based Categorization Engine** without AI, and still achieve near-AI accuracy. This is the system that solves “tanning bed float” and every similar edge case.

---

# 🎯 Goal

Categorize products using **deterministic logic + exceptions**, so 99% of uploads get correctly tagged **without needing AI**.

# 🧱 Core Components of the Rule Engine

| Component                          | Purpose                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Keyword Map**                    | Basic category tagging (what you already have)                       |
| **Phrase Overrides**               | Fix phrases that break keyword logic (“tanning bed”)                 |
| **Context Rules (Disambiguators)** | Handle words with multiple meanings (“bed”, “band”, “case”, “cover”) |
| **Negation & Cleanup Rules**       | Remove incorrect tags (“bed sheet” is bedding, not bed)              |

# 🧪 Real Example: “Tanning Bed Float”

| Engine Step                                       | Result                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Keyword: “bed” → Furniture                        | ❌ Wrong                        |
| Phrase Check: “tanning bed”                       | ✅ Beauty override              |
| Context: “float, uv, tanning” keyword set present | ✅ Confirms Beauty              |
| Output                                            | Category: **Beauty → Tanning** |

# 🧭 System Logic Flow

```
Input → Normalize → Phrase Rules (Exact Match) → Context Rules (Disambiguate) → Keyword Fallback → Clean Up (Negations)
```

---

# 🛠 Rule Structures (Simple JSON or DB Format)

### 1️⃣ Phrase Overrides (Absolute Priority)

```json
{
  "phrase": "tanning bed",
  "category": "beauty.tanning"
}
```

### 2️⃣ Disambiguation Rules (Context Logic)

```json
{
  "word": "bed",
  "routes": [
    { "if_any": ["tanning","uv","bronzer"], "category": "beauty.tanning" },
    { "if_any": ["dog","pet","kennel"], "category": "pets.beds" },
    { "if_any": ["inflatable","pool","float"], "category": "outdoors.water" },
    { "default": "home.furniture.beds" }
  ]
}
```

### 3️⃣ Negation Rules (To Clean Wrong Tags)

```json
{
  "pattern": "bed sheet|bedding",
  "remove": ["home.furniture.beds"],
  "add": ["home.textiles.bedding"]
}
```

# 🚦 Batch Processing Model (No AI Needed)

| Step                                     | Runs When?                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Real-time basic keyword tagging       | On upload                       |
| 🟡 Batch rule refinement (edge handling) | Nightly                         |
| 🔴 Manual intervention                   | Only if confidence fails (rare) |

# 🧾 Important: Edge Case Bank (Tagglo’s Secret Weapon)

We keep a **growing list of word collisions**, such as:

| Colliding Word | Fix with Context           |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Bed            | tanning / pet / pool       |
| Band           | watch / music / wedding    |
| Case           | phone / guitar / legal     |
| Cover          | sofa / book / phone / bed  |
| Float          | tanning / parade / fishing |
| Slide          | footwear / playground      |
| Cloud          | shoes / storage            |

---

# 🏗️ Implementation Plan (Lightweight & Scalable)

### Phase 1 – Set the Foundation

* Build rule tables (phrase, disambiguation, negation)
* Populate with top **50 edge cases**

### Phase 2 – Nightly Batch Tagger

* Run rule engine in batch mode
* Update stored categories only when changed

### Phase 3 – User Override Loop

* If user corrects category → store it as a new rule

# 🔥 Why This Works (And Scales to Millions)

| Feature          | Benefit                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| 100% Explainable | No black box             |
| Ultra Fast       | Milliseconds per product |
| Cheap            | $0 cost                  |
| Evolves          | Users train it naturally |

### 👇 Ready Below?

I’ll now:
✔ Draft your **initial edge case list** (beds, bands, covers, etc.)
✔ Provide a **Rule Engine Template** (so devs can build it tomorrow)

Say:
👉 **“Show me the edge cases list.”**
And we’ll start feeding your rule brain.
