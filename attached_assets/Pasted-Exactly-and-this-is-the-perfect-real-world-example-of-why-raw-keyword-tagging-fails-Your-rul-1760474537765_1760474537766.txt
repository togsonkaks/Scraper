Exactly — and this is **the perfect real-world example** of why raw keyword tagging fails.

Your rule engine sees **“baby”** → triggers “Baby Category.”
But in reality this was an **adult “baby tee” style shirt** (90s fashion).

# 🎯 Problem: Keyword Without Context

```
Title: “Vintage Baby Tee Fitted Crop Top”
System sees keyword: “baby”
→ Tags: Baby Clothing ❌ (wrong)
```

---

# 🧠 Solution: Context Rule (Meaning Firewall)

We add a single rule that says:

> **If "baby" appears with fashion/style terms → it is NOT a child product.**

---

# 🪨 Add to Collision Word List → “BABY”

| If “baby” with...                | Real Meaning       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| baby + size (0-24m)              | Kids/Baby Category |
| baby + tee / crop / Y2K / women  | Adult Fashion      |
| baby + shower, newborn, stroller | Baby Products      |

# 🧪 Rule Example (Generalized, No AI Needed)

```json
{
  "word": "baby",
  "routes": [
    { "if_any": ["tee","top","crop","style","women","y2k"], "category": "fashion.womens_tops" },
    { "if_any": ["shower","newborn","diapers","stroller"], "category": "baby.products" },
    { "default": "baby.clothing" }
  ]
}
```

# 🧭 Key Insight

You **DON’T** need to build a rule for every single product.
You **DO** need a generalized rule for the word **“baby”** so it can't hijack context again.

---

# 🏆 Why Rule System Still Wins

This is exactly why AI is **optional**, not required.

Because once you add a “baby” context rule:
✅ ALL future “baby tees” → correctly tagged as adult apparel
✅ ALL real baby products → still tagged properly

---

# 🧱 Collision Word Added: **BABY**

Now your critical collision list is:

```
bed, band, case, cover, float, slide, cloud, baby
```
