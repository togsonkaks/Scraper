To clean up your keyword system and stop tagging useless junk like **“simple,” “cute,” “day,” “nice,” “new,”** etc.—you need a **Stopword Filter Layer** before your keywords even fire.

These words add *zero category value* and should **never** trigger tags or categories.

# 🧹 Step 1: Build a “Do-Not-Tag” Word List (Stopwords)

| Word Type              | Examples                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Generic Adjectives** | simple, cute, nice, beautiful, lovely, elegant |
| **Filler Words**       | day, everyday, perfect, great, new             |
| **Marketing Fluff**    | premium, best, amazing, must-have              |
| **Time Words**         | summer, winter, daily, classic                 |

These words should be **ignored by the tagging engine entirely.**

# ⚙️ How to Filter Them

### 💡 Before keyword matching:

```
Raw Title → Remove Stopwords → Apply Category Keywords
```

**Example Title:**

> “Cute simple summer baby tee crop top”

**After Stopwords Filter:**

> “baby tee crop top” ← Now tagging logic sees only the meaningful words

---

# 🧪 Result: Better Accuracy Immediately

| Without Stopword Filter | With Stopword Filter |
|---|---|---|
| Tags “cute” (useless) | Ignores “cute” |
| False match on “summer” | Real focus on “baby tee” |
| Risk confusion | Cleaner context |

# 🗂️ Stopword Table Format (Simple & Powerful)

```json
{
  "stopwords": [
    "cute", "simple", "elegant", "nice", "perfect",
    "premium", "amazing", "new", "day", "daily",
    "classic", "modern", "beautiful", "lovely"
  ]
}
```

---

# 🛑 Important: Don’t Delete Words Like “baby,” “cloud,” “float”

Those are **collision words** → send to context logic
Stopwords = boring adjectives / fluff

---

# 🔧 Dev Implementation (Simple)

* Strip stopwords before keyword check
* Use regex: `\b(simple|cute|nice|new|day)\b` → remove
* Then reduce double spaces and continue processing
