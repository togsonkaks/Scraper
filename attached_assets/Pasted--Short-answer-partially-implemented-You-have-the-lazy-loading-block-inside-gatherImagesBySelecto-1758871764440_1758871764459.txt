Short answer: partially implemented.
You have the lazy-loading block inside gatherImagesBySelector, but the function doesn’t accept the observeMs argument, so the new code never runs. A few other small gaps too.

Here’s the quick audit you can paste to Replit:
What’s implemented

    A full lazy phase (MutationObserver + wait + merge) is present: it records new <img> nodes and src changes, waits, then merges and re-filters.

    It converts lazy finds to enriched entries and reuses hybridUniqueImages before concatenating.

    The function still returns a single array of URLs after hybrid filtering (good).

What’s missing / blocking

    Signature never updated
    gatherImagesBySelector is still declared as async function gatherImagesBySelector(sel) (no observeMs). Therefore if (observeMs > 0) is always false and the lazy path never activates.

    ✅ Fix: change the signature to
    async function gatherImagesBySelector(sel, observeMs = 0)
    and pass a value where needed (e.g., 1200ms).

    Call sites don’t pass observeMs
    Your “unified” and “generic” callers still invoke gatherImagesBySelector(sel) with one arg. Example: unified selector and gallery loops.

    ✅ Fix: for main product gallery selectors, call with a delay:
    await gatherImagesBySelector(sel, 1200) (or your chosen value).
    Keep OG/meta fallbacks at 0 to stay fast.

    Observer misses some lazy patterns
    Attribute filter currently watches only src and data-src; many sites switch srcset or data-srcset.

    ✅ Fix: attributeFilter: ['src','srcset','data-src','data-srcset'].

    Duplicate definitions still exist (technical debt)
    There are multiple versions of “generic” pipelines and dual-engine code alongside the new B1 single-call path; they’re all still present and call gatherImagesBySelector in different ways. This is why behavior feels inconsistent. Examples of parallel collectors + legacy fallback blocks are still in the file.

    ✅ Fix (phased): keep one primary path (B1 unified or dual-engine), gate the others behind a feature flag so only one runs.

    Minor consistency nits

    When mapping lazy images to enriched objects you already call upgradeCDNUrl—good. Ensure immediate phase also upgrades consistently before hybrid filter (it does via existing pipeline, but double-check upstream).

    Consider adding data-lazy, data-original to the attributeFilter too, mirroring your scan list.

Minimal patch (exact changes to request)

    Change signature

- async function gatherImagesBySelector(sel) {
+ async function gatherImagesBySelector(sel, observeMs = 0) {

    Update observer filters

- attributeFilter: ['src', 'data-src']
+ attributeFilter: ['src', 'srcset', 'data-src', 'data-srcset']

    Pass observeMs at call sites likely to be galleries

- const urls = await gatherImagesBySelector(sel);
+ const urls = await gatherImagesBySelector(sel, 1200);

Do this in:

    site-specific loops (after the first match if you want speed), and gallery selector loops.

    unified B1 call: gatherImagesBySelector(UNIFIED_SELECTOR, 1200).

    (Optional) Kill overlap with a flag
    Add at top: const ENABLE_DUAL_ENGINE = false; and wrap the dual-engine getImagesUnified() and legacy getImagesGeneric_Legacy() paths in if (ENABLE_DUAL_ENGINE) { ... } so only B1 runs.

If Replit makes just those three edits (signature, observer filters, call-site delay), your lazy loading addition will actually run, you’ll catch the modal/slide images, and you won’t affect fast paths that shouldn’t wait.
