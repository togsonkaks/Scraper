Exactly — and that’s WHY we don’t hard-code “baby tee = always adult.”
**A baby *could* absolutely wear a baby tee** (like an infant T-shirt).
So the system must be **context-flexible**, not rigid.

# 🧭 The Real Challenge:

“**Baby tee**” could belong to:

* **Adult crop-style fashion** (Y2K teen/women’s top)
* **Actual baby clothing (0–24 months)**

The keyword is the same — **but the *surrounding language* tells the truth.**

## 🔍 How We Solve It (Context Decision Tree)

### ✅ Adult “Baby Tee” Clues:

| Word Nearby  | Meaning        |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| crop         | Adult fashion  |
| fitted       | Adult fashion  |
| Y2K          | Adult trend    |
| women / teen | Adult category |
| graphic      | Adult top      |

### ✅ Infant “Baby Tee” Clues:

| Word Nearby    | Meaning       |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| newborn        | Baby product  |
| 0-24M / 6-12M  | Baby sizing   |
| infant         | Baby product  |
| onesie         | Baby clothing |
| cute / toddler | Baby category |

## 🧪 Rule Logic (Human Language Imitation)

```
IF “baby” appears AND size keywords (0-24m, infant, newborn) → BABY CATEGORY  
IF “baby” appears AND fashion keywords (crop, y2k, fitted, teen) → WOMEN’S FASHION  
```

We don’t “lock” baby tee to adult —
We let **context decide each time**.

| ----- | ----------------------- |
| baby  | ✅ Yes (adult vs infant) |
| bed   | ✅ Yes                   |

# 🏁 Key Takeaway

👉 You **cannot solve this with keywords alone.**
You need a **context layer** (simple rules for now) that looks at meaning, not just words.
