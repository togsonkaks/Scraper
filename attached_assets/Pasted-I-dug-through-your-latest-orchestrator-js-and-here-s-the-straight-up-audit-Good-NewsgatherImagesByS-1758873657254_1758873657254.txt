I dug through your latest orchestrator.js and here’s the straight-up audit: Good NewsgatherImagesBySelector(sel, observeMs = 0) is implemented correctly.It has the lazy loading phase with a MutationObserver.It does respect observeMs > 0.Attribute filter includes ['src', 'srcset', 'data-src', 'data-srcset'] → better coverage.Immediate collection and lazy phase are cleanly separated.Debug logs are crystal-clear ( LAZY, LAZY LOADING, etc.). Issues / OverlapsCall Sites Don’t Use observeMs:Everywhere else in the code still calls it like:await gatherImagesBySelector('.product-gallery img');That means lazy loading is never triggered. Needs updating to:await gatherImagesBySelector('.product-gallery img', 1200);Duplicate Filtering Logic:Inside gatherImagesBySelector, you’re re-checking junk patterns (e.g., _web.png, yotpo.com, boucle) multiple times for src, srcset, and <picture> sources.Same block repeated 3 times = bloat. Fix: Extract a helper like:function isJunkImage(url) { return /(_web\.png|_modal_|yotpo\.com|-\d{3}\.png|boucle|basketweave|velvet|cushion-image|cld\.accentuate\.io)/i.test(url);}Then call once for all attributes.Too Many Scoring Passes:hybridUniqueImages() already filters aggressively (junk, duplicates, CDN upgrades).But gatherImagesBySelector is pre-blocking some of the same things.This double-filtering adds noise and slows things down. Fix: Let hybridUniqueImages() handle 90% of filtering, keep only critical domain-specific filters (Shopify, Yotpo).Debug Duplication:Every branch logs “ BLOCKED” with different emojis.Debug is useful, but right now it’s too verbose.You want: one pass, one reason per URL. My Recommendations (what to tell Replit)Keep one main function:gatherImagesBySelector(sel, observeMs = 0)Don’t split into 3 near-identical loops for src, srcset, picture. Just normalize all candidate URLs into a single array → pass into hybridUniqueImages().Deduplicate Filters:Move Shopify/theme junk checks + generic junk regex into isJunkImage().Call once before adding URL to enrichedUrls.Simplify Debug:Instead of 30 different “ BLOCKED” logs, log once per image with reason. Example: BLOCKED [srcset, Shopify theme asset]: logo.pngUpdate Call Sites:Any gallery selector that needs lazy support → call with observeMs = 1200.Example:await gatherImagesBySelector('.gallery img', 1200); Bottom line: You don’t need 5 different scraping functions.Keep 1 master collector (gatherImagesBySelector) + 1 hybrid filter (hybridUniqueImages).Drop repeated junk filtering inside each attribute loop.Pass observeMs at the right call sites.That trims the fat, keeps debug readable, and makes lazy loading actually work.
