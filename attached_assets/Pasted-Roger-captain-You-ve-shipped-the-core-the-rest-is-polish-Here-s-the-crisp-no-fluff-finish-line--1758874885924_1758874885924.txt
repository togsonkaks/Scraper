Roger, captain. You’ve shipped the core; the rest is polish. Here’s the crisp, no-fluff finish line.

# ✅ Acknowledge what’s already done

* `observeMs` wired at gallery call sites. Good.
* Observer watches `src/srcset/data-src/data-srcset`. Good.
* `isJunkImage()` centralizes junk filters. Good.
* Debug messages are clear. Good.

# 🎯 Final 3 micro-upgrades (low risk, high signal)

## 1) Early-exit guard (prevents pointless waiting)

Drop this right after Phase-1 `scanOnce()` inside `gatherImagesBySelector`:

```js
// If we already have plenty, skip waiting for lazy
if (observeMs > 0 && out.length >= 12) return out;
```

## 2) Production debug toggle (silence logs in prod)

At top of the file:

```js
const DEBUG_IMG = true;  // flip false in prod
const dbg = (...a) => { if (DEBUG_IMG) console.log(...a); };
```

Then replace any `console.log(...)` in this function with `dbg(...)`.

## 3) Observer attribute consistency (double-check alignment)

You’ve got `['src','srcset','data-src','data-srcset']`. Make sure your **scan list** includes the same (plus your lazy attrs like `data-lazy`, `data-original`, `data-large_image`, `data-zoom-image`, `data-defer-src`, `data-defer-srcset`, `data-flickity-lazyload`). The point: **what you watch == what you parse**. If they already match, done.

# 🤷 On “don’t re-score twice”

Your pushback is fair. If `upgradeCDNUrl()` in the collector is strictly **idempotent + non-destructive** and your real **scoring** only happens downstream, you’re fine. Two asks to keep it clean:

* Make `upgradeCDNUrl(url)` a **pure function** (same input → same output; never mutates state).
* Add a tiny unit test (or inline assertion) to guarantee it’s idempotent:

```js
const u1 = upgradeCDNUrl(url);
const u2 = upgradeCDNUrl(u1);
if (u1 !== u2) dbg('WARN upgradeCDNUrl not idempotent', { u1, u2 });
```

# ✅ Quick acceptance checklist for the team

* [ ] Lazy pages: Phase-2 adds images; static pages: Phase-2 adds none.
* [ ] With guard in place, total wait doesn’t exceed ~1.2–1.5s on lazy pages; ~0 on fast pages.
* [ ] No duplicate “junk” blocks anywhere (all through `isJunkImage()`).
* [ ] Logs can be silenced globally by toggling `DEBUG_IMG=false`.
* [ ] `upgradeCDNUrl` proven idempotent (optional warn only).

# TL;DR

You’re 90% there. Ship the **early-exit**, add the **debug flag**, verify **observer/scan parity**. Everything else is already buttoned up. Keep moving. 🚀
